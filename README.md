# learn

This is not an open projects, it's only a "showcase" of some of my work.

I used this repository as a base, and added others as submodules so I can keep things organized.

It's separated by programming languages plus a testing repository.

##### My objective with this...

... is to keep track and share the new stuff I learn and the exercises I do with some languages to train them.
